    <p class="hide">In Roman mythology, the Strix was a large foreboding creature that fed on human flesh, associated
      with witches, and foretold ill omens. It was associated with the appearance and calls of owls. The barred owl
      certainly can feel a bit offputting or portending of misfortune. Their eyes are black, calls bizarre, and
      movement silent. While riding my bike along a trail one night, I had one land mere feet away and cause me to
      nearly fall off in fright. It's probably one of my favorite memories being able to see one up close.</p>

        <button class="cycle">Cycle Images</button>
      </div>
      <p class="hide">These kingbirds are named as such for their tendency to act like kings and aggressively scare off
        larger birds like hawks or even people, hence the Tyrannus which is derived from tyrant.
        They migrate up to Kansas in flocks during the Summer to lay eggs. They can be found higher in trees or
        sometimes nesting in electric poles. Some people characterize their vocalizations as squeaky toys, personally, I
        hear it as a "chweep-chuweep" type of sound.

      <p>Northern Cardinal</p>
      <div class="buttons down">
        <button class="info">Click for Info</button>
        <button class="cycle">Cycle Images</button>
      </div>
      <p class="hide">I'm not exactly sure what the reasoning was for being named cardinalis. It could be because it
        means chief in Latin and male cardinals have a chieftan-esque look. All I know is these birds whistle a lot and
        the difference between male and female is stark.</p>

      <p>Hirundo</br>Rustica</p>
      <p>Barn Swallow</p>
      <div class="buttons down">
        <button class="info">Click for Info</button>
        <button class="cycle">Cycle Images</button>
      </div>
      <p class="hide">Hirundo Rustica loosely translates to countryside swallow. Rustica is closer to rustic than rust
        and isn't referencing the rust colored belly that they have.
        I really like swallows for their flight patterns and interesting nests. They can often by found on the underside
        of bridges or overhangs near water.

      <p>Zenaida</br>Macroura</p>
      <p>Mourning Dove</p>
      <div class="buttons down">
        <button class="info">Click for Info</button>
        <button class="cycle">Cycle Images</button>
      </div>
      <p class="hide">They might be called doves, but they're basically pigeons. The name Zenaida comes from the Greek
        term for "dedicated to zeus", however the doves themselves were named after the wife of the person who first
        catalogued the species.
        Zeus' bird is actually an eagle. Macroura means long tail. In Kansas, they can be found year-round pretty much
        anywhere, just listen for their soft coo-ing sounds. You can also often find mating pairs "kissing" or "billing"
        where they affectionately peck at eachother's heads.

      <p>Ardea</br>Herodias</p>
      <p>Great Blue Heron</p>
      <div class="buttons down">
        <button class="info">Click for Info</button>
        <button class="cycle">Cycle Images</button>
      </div>
      <p class="hide">The Great Blue Heron's scientific name isn't very interesting as the Ardea portion is just the
        word for Heron in Latin, and Herodias is the same but for Greek. I actually took most of these pictures just off
        of campus on the little walking trail in front of the ITC. </p>

    <div class="panel panel6">
      <p>Cyanocitta</br>Cristata</p>
      <p>Blue Jay</p>
      <div class="buttons down">
        <button class="info">Click for Info</button>
        <button class="cycle">Cycle Images</button>
      </div>
      <p class="hide">Cyano means dark blue and kitta(citta) means jay in Greek, while cristata means tufted or crested.
        So
        their scientific name is basically crested dark blue jay. Blue jays belong to the corvidae family and are
        related to crows, ravens, and magpies.</p>
